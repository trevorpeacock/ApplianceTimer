# ApplianceTimer
RP2040/Raspberry Pi Pico display/button interface designed for switching mains appliances. Designed to be as easy to use as possible.

![Assembled unit](images/Assembled.png)

Interface in centre can be operated by most people with one button:
* Press the button once to turn on the appliance, and leave it on for an hour
* Press the button again to add an extra hour to the timer
* Hold the button to turn the device off and cancel the timer

Pressing the two outer buttons simultaneously will enter a menu system where time/date and schedules can be set.
Pressing any invalid combination of buttons will display help messages, with instructions pointing to the appropriate buttons.

The clock supports daylight savings for any nth sunday of any month (nth and last nth Sunday of the month)

# Overview

The unit is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico. Raspberry pi pico is attached to:
  * I2C oled display
  * three buttons to GND
  * an RGB LED (common anode)
  * MOSFET
  * DS1302 clock

The unit is in turn connected to a mains relay (via MOSFET) to switch an appliance. In our application, the RPI is powered from an LM7805, which in turn is powered by a DIN rail power supply.
